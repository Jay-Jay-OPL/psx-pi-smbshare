# psx-pi-smbshare
SMB sharing for Multiman and Open Playstation Loader on Raspberry Pi

## How it works
psx-pi-smbshare is a preconfigured Raspbian based image for Raspberry Pi 1, 2, and  3.  It runs a [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) share, a pi-compatible build of [ps3netsrv](https://github.com/dirkvdb/ps3netsrv--), and reconfigures the ethernet port to act as a router.  This gives low-latency, direct access to the Samba service through an ethernet cable connection between a PS2/PS3 and Raspberry Pi.  This configuration is achieved by running [setup.sh](/setup.sh).  A pre-supplied [image](https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare/releases/download/untagged-02de8085ec9e6286780c/psx-smbshare-raspbian-stretch-lite.img) can be applied directly to a Micro-SD card using something like [etcher.io](https://etcher.io/).  The image will expand to use the full available space on the SD card when the OS is first booted.

## What you can do with it
psx-pi-smbshare works out of the box on PS3 with [MultiMAN](http://www.psx-place.com/threads/update2-multiman-v-04-81-00-01-02-base-update-stealth-for-cex-dex-updates-by-deank.12145/).  This functionality allows you to stream and backup up various games and media to the Samba share service running on the Raspberry Pi.

psx-pi-smbshare also works out of the box on PS2 with [Open Playstation Loader](https://github.com/ifcaro/Open-PS2-Loader) and supports streaming of PS2 backups located on the Samba share service. It can also work with [POPStarter for SMB](https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/smb-mode) to allow streaming of PS1 games from Open Playstation Loader.

psx-pi-smbshare supports an optional ability to route traffic from the ethernet port through a wireless network connection.  

# Quickstart

** Prequisites **
* Raspberry Pi 1, 2, or 3
* Micro-SD Card (8GB+ suggested)

## Flash the image
Download the latest [psx-pi-smbshare release image](https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare/releases/download/untagged-02de8085ec9e6286780c/psx-smbshare-raspbian-stretch-lite.img) and burn it to a Micro-SD card with [etcher.io](http://etcher.io)

## Configuring Wireless Network
If you wish to configure the wireless network on a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, you need to add a file to **/boot** on the Micro-SD card.  

Create a file on **/boot** named **wpa_supplicant.conf** and supply the following:

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1

    network={
            ssid="<SSID>"
            psk="<PASSWORD>"
    }

When the pi is next booted, it will attempt to connect to the wireless network in this configuration.  You are then able to access the raspberry pi on the network and allow for outbound connections from a PS2/PS3 over the wireless network.  
The raspberry pi is configured to have a hostname `smbshare` with a user `pi` and a password of `raspberry`.  

## Accessing the SMB Share
With a wireless network configured, you should be able to access the SMB share by visiting `\\SMBSHARE\share` on windows or `smb://smbshare/share` on Mac / Linux.

The share is preconfigured with a folder structure to accomodate ps3netsrv and Open Playstation Loader expected file paths.

## Configuring for use with MultiMAN on PS3

** Prequisites **
* Playstation 3 running a [recent release of MultiMAN](http://store.brewology.com/ahomebrew.php?brewid=24)

1. Connect the pi ethernet port into the ethernet port of the PS3 and power the pi using the PS3 usb or an external power supply 
2. In the PS3 XMB select "Settings" => "Network Settings" => "Internet Connection Settings" and configure to connect using the ethernet connection
3. Launch MultiMAN
4. Select "Settings" => "Network Servers"
5. Configure using the Ip Address '192.168.2.1' (ip to the smbshare assigned by dhcp server running on the Pi) and Port '38008' (default)
6. You should see new section for the network server under 'Photos' / 'Music' / 'Video' / 'Retro' and a new location to copy games to when using copy ISO in the 'Games' menu.  

PS3 Games backed up to the network server can be found and loaded from the "Games" menu in MultiMAN.
PS1, PS2, and PSP games can be found and loaded from "Retro" => "PSONE" "PS2" OR "PSP"  
PS2 backups must be loaded from the HDD but can be copied directly to the SMB server.

## Configuring for use with Open Playstation Loader

** Prerequisites **
* Playstation 2 fat or slim running a [recent release of Open Playstation Loader](http://www.ps2-home.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=29251#p29251) 

1. Connect the pi ethernet port into the ethernet port of the PS2 and power the pi using the PS2 usb or an external power supply 
2. Boot Open Playstation Loader and select "Settings" => "Network Config".  
Ensure that the following options are set:

        Ethernet Link Mode = Auto
        PS2 
            IP address type = DHCP
        SMB Server
            Address Type = IP
            Address = 192.168.2.1
            Port = 445
            Share = share
            Password = <not set>
3. Reconnect or restart Open Playstation Loader
4. PS2 Games will be listed under "ETH Games".  To add PS2 games, copy valid .iso backups to `\\SMBSHARE\share\DVD` or `\\SMBSHARE\share\CD`

## Configuring for use with POPSLoader on Open Playstation Loader

** Prerequisites **
* Ensure that you have successfully followed the steps above for "Configuring for use with Open Playstation Loader"

1. Download the [ps2 network modules](https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/network_modules.7z) 
2. Extract the POPSTARTER folder 
3. Modify IPCONFIG.DAT to:
        
        192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1
4. Modify SMBCONFIG.DATA to:
        
        192.168.2.1 share
5. Copy the POPSTARTER folder to your memory card
6. Hop on the internet and look for a copy of a file named "POPS_IOX.PAK" with md5sum "a625d0b3036823cdbf04a3c0e1648901" and copy it to `\\SMBSHARE\share\POPS`.  This file is not included for "reasons".
7. PS1 backups must be converted to .VCD and run through a special renaming program in order to show up in OPL.

    To convert .bin + .cue backups, you can use the included "CUE2POP_2_3.EXE" located in `\\SMBSHARE\share\POPS\CUE2POPS v2.3`
    Copy your .VCD backups to `\\SMBSHARE\share\POPS` then run `\\SMBSHARE\share\POPS\OPLM\OPL_Manager.exe` to rename your files appropriately.
    
    Once converted and properly renamed, your games will show up under the "PS1 Games" section of OPL
